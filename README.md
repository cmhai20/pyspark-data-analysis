# PySpark Data Analysis Project

This repository contains PySpark code for analyzing various datasets including video game sales, football match events, and time series data.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates data processing and analysis using Apache Spark, implementing:

Video game sales analysis (2006-2015)
Football match and player statistics processing
Time-based prediction models using Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms

## Data Sources
The data used in this project includes:

* Video game sales data (video_game_sales.csv)
* Football events data (events.parquet)
* Football matches data (matches.parquet)
* Football players data (players.parquet)
* Time series measurements data (containing weather and power consumption metrics)

## Requirements
* Apache Spark 3.1+
* Python 3.7+
* PySpark ML libraries

# Results
The analysis generates several insights:

* Top publishers in the North American video game market (2006-2015)
* Premier League standings for the 2017-2018 season
* Teams with the lowest pass success ratios in different leagues
* Players with highest plus-minus statistics
* Time prediction accuracy using different feature combinations
